## **Keep your head up and you got this !!**

When I first started I found it rough and overwhelming at times but had great people to help me understand and get to where I am today.

I hope that these resources help anyone succeed in these topics. 

# Computer Science
> ## [CSC148: Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.notion.so/CSC148-Introduction-to-Computer-Science-14dda0ca98684059a3a95f48c12677f6)
> This can be a really fun course once you get the intuition behind how things work. Try to code more rather than just taking notes. Allow yourself to take some risks ... It's totally okay to break your code, that's how you learn!

> ## [CSC207: Software Design](https://www.notion.so/CSC207-Software-Design-1655c009d3f049b7b343d390f0ea7810)
> This course was pretty fun because you get to build something from scratch at the end using all the acquired java skills, knowledge in design patterns and all the git you learned throughout the course!
> Make sure to git commit and git push through!

# Math
> ## [MAT102: Introduction to Mathematical Proofs ](https://www.notion.so/MAT102-Introduction-to-Mathematical-Proofs-b2b7bb2fdca24b2596d1a326ec0b6321)
> This course is more theoretical, so it's really more about understanding the concept and reasoning behind the theorems rather than just computing the formulas. Once you start understanding these concepts you will gain a greater appreciation for proofs and the brilliance of the people behind them.

> ## [MAT223: Linear Algebra I](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TZvdzqTh6n9WNmqwfLreuUTwc1ZOWMx6/view?usp=sharing)
> Tutorials are super useful in this course, they really help you solidify the knowledge.
> Also, watching [3Blue1Brown's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B) Linear Algebra playlist is incredibly useful!

> ## [MAT232: Calculus of Several Variables](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z4aI2fIzYZjzeFWQBob-Qqux0rFuYECd/view?usp=sharing)
> There is lots of homework so try to stay on top of it.
> Watching [Prof Leonard's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H6HrfX_qCA&list=PLDesaqWTN6EQ2J4vgsN1HyBeRADEh4Cw-&index=24) playlist helps understand the why behind each concept better.
