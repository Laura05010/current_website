# This is my personal website
I used the Fresh Theme for [Gatsby](https://github.com/mishal23/gatsby-starter-fresh) and changed it up to include a blog, a page for my art projects and much more!

Working on this site allowed me to expand my knowledge in Gatsby, learn to query images, and definitely become a pro at markdown!

I would like to thank the author of the gatsby theme, [Mishaal Shah](https://github.com/mishal23).

I would also like to thank [Kyrel Jerome](https://github.com/KyrelJerome) for teaching about how queries work so that I could be succesful in uploading images for the site, and thank [Arnav Bansal](https://github.com/lunaroyster) for teaching me to succesfully upload the website.
